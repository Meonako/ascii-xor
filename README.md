# ASCII XOR Reverse Finder

With this tool, you won't need to calculate by yourself again

# But why?
</div>

Most of the tools I've come across, are either

1. too complicated for a dumb person like me or
2. just straight up calculator (you know, like normal calculator but with fixed XOR operation).

  
So I decided to call this 'reverse' calculator/finder or whatever idk pls teach me English  
Basically, you input the "output" of string you want and it'll find all possible values
